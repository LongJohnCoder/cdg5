# The CDG5 project

The CDG5 project is an effort to thoroughly reverse-engineer Mac OS 9.2.2, the final release of the "Classic" Mac OS. We place an emphasis on supporting late-model PowerPC G4-based Macs, and also on hacking new features into the OS (e.g. support for >1.5 GB RAM).

Our work is spread over several GitHub repositories:

- 3 MB 68k ROM: <http://github.com/elliotnunn/mac-rom>
- 4 MB PowerPC rom, inc. NanoKernel: <http://github.com/elliotnunn/powermac-rom>
- Bootable "Mac OS ROM" file: <http://github.com/elliotnunn/newworld-rom>
- Disk-based Start Manager: <http://github.com/elliotnunn/boot3>
- Bootloader-NanoKernel shim: <http://github.com/elliotnunn/wedge>

Some code patching tools:

- Move resources around: <http://github.com/elliotnunn/zcp>
- Patch PowerPC binaries: <http://github.com/elliotnunn/patchpef>
- Patch 68k MPW code objects: <http://github.com/elliotnunn/patchobj>

Most of our testing, and some of our discussion, takes place on the [MacOS9Lives](http://macos9lives.com) forums.
